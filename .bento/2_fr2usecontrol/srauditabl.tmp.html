<p>The control system shall provide the capability to generate audit records relevant to security for the following categories: access control, request errors, operating system events&#8230;&#8203; Individual audit records shall include the timestamp, source (originating device, software process or human user account), category, type, event ID and event result. It must be possible to assign the changes to an author and this author must be clearly identifiable.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Changes to the data are documented by the system and all previous versions remain traceable. In addition, changes can only be made by a user who is authorized to do so. For each change, the system stores a user who has made the corresponding change. If a multi-level release is required, the system also documents who released the change.</p>

<p>FluxAPI should provide methods to generate and store audit records for all relevant security events. These methods should ensure that each audit record includes the necessary details such as timestamp, source, category, type, event ID, and event result. The system should also ensure that changes are traceable to an identifiable author and that only authorized users can make changes. Monitor and manage the size of log files to prevent HDD overflow.</p>
